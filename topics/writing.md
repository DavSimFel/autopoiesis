# Writing & Editing

## Instructions

When writing or editing documents:

1. **Understand the audience** — who will read this and what do they need?
2. **Structure first** — outline before drafting, headings before paragraphs
3. **Be concise** — every sentence should earn its place
4. **Use active voice** — prefer "X does Y" over "Y is done by X"
5. **One idea per paragraph** — don't overload the reader
6. **Edit ruthlessly** — cut filler words, redundant phrases, unnecessary qualifiers

## Editing Checklist

- [ ] Clear thesis or purpose statement
- [ ] Logical flow between sections
- [ ] No jargon without explanation (unless audience is technical)
- [ ] Consistent tone and style
- [ ] Grammar and spelling correct
- [ ] Formatting aids readability (headings, lists, whitespace)
