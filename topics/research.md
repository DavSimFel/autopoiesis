# Deep Research

## Instructions

When conducting research:

1. **Clarify the question** — restate the research question precisely
2. **Search broadly first** — cast a wide net with multiple queries
3. **Evaluate sources** — prefer primary sources, peer-reviewed work, official docs
4. **Cross-reference claims** — verify key facts across multiple sources
5. **Synthesize findings** — don't just list results, draw conclusions
6. **Acknowledge gaps** — be explicit about what you couldn't find or verify

## Output Format

Structure your research as:
- **Question**: The precise research question
- **Key Findings**: Numbered list of substantive findings with sources
- **Analysis**: Your synthesis and interpretation
- **Confidence**: How confident you are in the findings (high/medium/low)
- **Open Questions**: What remains unanswered
