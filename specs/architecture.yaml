# Architecture constraints — verified by scripts/arch_check.py
# See issue #156 for rationale.

# Module dependency rules: module -> allowed internal imports
dependencies:
  agent: [models, store, tools, infra, approval, display, topic_manager, toolset_builder, model_resolution, run_simple, prompts]
  server: [agent, models, store, approval, infra, display, tools, chat, db, topic_manager, toolset_builder, model_resolution, skills, skillmaker_tools, prompts, io_utils, run_simple]
  tools: [models, store, infra, db, agent]  # agent: exec_tool enqueues work items
  store: [db, models]
  infra: [models, db, store, topic_manager, tools]
  approval: [models, db]
  display: [models, infra]
  # Root modules (chat, toolset_builder, etc.) are not constrained here

# Explicitly forbidden imports (regardless of dependency rules)
forbidden:
  - tools -> server        # tools must not know about server
  - store -> agent         # store must not know about agent
  - store -> server        # store must not know about server
  - approval -> agent      # approval must not know about agent
  - approval -> server     # approval must not know about server

# Maximum lines per file
max_lines: 300

# Files exempt from max_lines (pre-existing, to be refactored)
max_lines_exempt:
  - store/knowledge.py     # 340 lines — tracked for refactor

# Pattern constraints — these strings must not appear in source
no_globals: []
